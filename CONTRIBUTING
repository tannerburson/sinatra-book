General guidelines for patches:

* Keep lines to approximately 80 characters or less.  This is to allow git to do patches at the line level.
* No embedded HTML.  We need to render to LaTeX (and then PDF), which won't support it.


Submitting Patches

* Fork this repo on GitHub and send pull requests
* Find cschneid or cypher23 on #sinatra (Freenode) and get a git format-patch to them.
